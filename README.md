# Worldwide-Weather-Forecast

## Discription

As a user of weather apps 
I wanted to creat one to that would help me out. 
This weather dashboard will allow users to search for a city to get the current weather and 5 day forecast. It will display the the city name, the date, and an icon that is representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index will be color coded.
